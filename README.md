Install reuirements using requirements.txt

We have to then setup the configuration using config.py in the src folder (there is a config_example you can rename that)

The program expects the username and token (I had hardcoded my url)

The commands moving forward are mentioned there, it should be noted be noted that all the tickets are numbered 1-25 on every page,
you can number it and it will take you to the ticket on that page itself.

To run the program we have to run main.py

Here are some screenshots
